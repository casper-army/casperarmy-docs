# Introduction

![alt-text](/pic/we_are_casperarmy.jpg)

## What is CasperArmy.org?

CasperArmy.org is a team of business developers, creators, blockchain developers and enthusiasts of the Casper Network, who decided to help bring the ideas of the community to life on the Casper Network. Our platform is a hub for creating secure projects on the Casper network, while connecting builders to DAO and venture capital companies. The platform aims to reduce investment risk as much as possible, exclude fraud, and maximise the success of projects starting under the wings of CasperArmy.

CasperArmy operates exclusively on the Casper Network, using all possible mechanisms of the network, which significantly surpasses other blockchain networks in issues such as security, scalability, among other technologies Casper can offer.

The Casperarmy.org platform will use the native token of the Casper Network — CSPR for its functioning. At the moment, there are no plans to introduce a CasperArmy token, and it is not CasperArmy’s goal.

# Project Verification

Creators who have submitted an application to us to support their project for incubation on the CasperArmy platform will be required to undergo a rigorous KYC process, communicate frequently with the community, and carry out social tasks, such as AMAs, on the casperarmy.org platform to keep community members well informed.

The community will evaluate the idea you have submitted to us and give you their thoughts, which will have a say in the decision process of CasperArmy deciding whether to incubate or not. Once CasperArmy’s review team has positively reviewed your project and the CasperAmy community responded positively, you will be required to sign a contract with CasperArmy.

Agreements will be in digital form and signed through Casper Labs’ Immutable Document Signatures on the Blockchain (https://app.caspersign.io/) and will be made available for public viewing. From that point on, the data of the project creators will be public to the CasperArmy community. You will collect a certain portion of funds as a creator from the pre-sale of your project (seed round), in the form of CSPR coins. Coins will be distributed and paid to the creator of the project in stages, according to the work schedule approved by the CasperArmy community, which you as a creator must present to the community via a roadmap. The payout will be done through a special contract on the Casper network and be automated. To ensure the payout, the voting CasperArmy community must approve it based on whether they believe the project has met targets pre-agreed. This mechanism is used to ensure security for investors and people participating in your project on the principles of Venture Capitals in seed rounds — the CasperArmy community. It also aims to eliminate potential bad intentions of the creator, motivate the project creator to work on the project, and help manage the project financing.

## Collaborative & Safe investing for the community.

The CasperArmy organisation will help you, as a creator, establish partnerships and recruit business angels to fund your startup. Your first “business angel” will be CasperArmy and its community, which through a voting system will help you take direction and develop the idea you present in your pitch deck. CasperArmy will also help you list your project on a launchpad after the incubation period, and the active CasperArmy community will help promote your project in exchange for an airdrop, or early participation in a private pre-sale called seed round as a Venture Capitals entity. As a Creator, you are also eligible to apply for an interest-free loan from CasperArmy, which you can repay in your token at the seed round price. The CasperArmy team will decide the loan allocation.

## For the Community

The idea behind CasperArmy.org is to create a Layer 2 ecosystem on the Casper network, free from scams and other attempts to defraud investors. That is why it is so important for us to be fully transparent about CasperArmy’s activities and the Creators who will offer their startups on Casperarmy.org. Access to the platform will be granted only to those who are members of the CasperArmy community on Telegram and/or Discord and have a registered user account on Casperarmy.org. CasperArmy’s community member reputation system plays a key role in gaining voting access. Therefore, it is important to be regularly active in the community channels. If you are not active for a certain period, you will lose points. When you reach the lower point limit, you will be removed from the voting community, meaning you will no longer be able to use the platform and will no longer be able to take advantage of the benefits that the Casperarmy.org platform will offer.

Removal from the community will not be taken into account for the owners of CasperArmy NFT’s, details on https://litepaper.casperarmy.io. A detailed description of the reputation points system will be dedicated to a separate entry soon. CasperArmyNFT (Elite Club) holders will not be required to stay active in social media activities organised by CasperArmy.

## User Accounts

Log in to the user’s profile/accounts will be done via Casper Signer. In the user profile, the user will have access to:

    Information about the points held in the CasperArmy social channels
    Management of your NFTs and your army appointment ticket
    Information on points earned is integrated with CasperArmy bots installed on our Telegram and Discord social channels
    History of campaigns engaged in on casperarmy.org.
    Information about what airdrop/rebate from the partner/creator was assigned to the user
    and more…
    
## Summary

To summarise, the CasperArmy platform will do the following:

    Develop project ideas using our unique incubation system, providing guidance from start to finish
    Provide transparency to the Casper community, and give them a voice to influence decisions on projects
    Every day, the team does its best to respond to the community’s requirements. Our mission is to promote
    transparency, honesty, and the Casper Network.
