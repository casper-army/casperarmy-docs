# 2.4 Incubation HUB

Our mission is to finance, launch, grow and accelerate internet businesses built on the Casper Network blockchain with our data, technology and analytics. We help in establishing partnerships that will be beneficial for both parties. With the help of our data resources, specialists and advisers, we identify the business opportunities of the project, conduct internal experiments on our platform, research public interest by voting governance  and isolate profitable projects with high potential for revenue growth.
