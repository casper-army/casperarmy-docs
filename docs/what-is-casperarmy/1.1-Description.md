# 1.1 Description

## What is CasperArmy.org?

CasperArmy.org is a team of business developers, creators, blockchain developers and enthusiasts of the Casper Network, who decided to help bring the ideas of the community to life on the Casper Network. Our platform is a hub for creating secure projects on the Casper network, while connecting builders to DAO and venture capital companies. The platform aims to reduce investment risk as much as possible, exclude fraud, and maximise the success of projects starting under the wings of CasperArmy.

CasperArmy operates exclusively on the Casper Network, using all possible mechanisms of the network, which significantly surpasses other blockchain networks in issues such as security, scalability, among other technologies Casper can offer.

The Casperarmy.org platform will use the native token of the Casper Network — CSPR for its functioning. At the moment, there are no plans to introduce a CasperArmy token, and it is not CasperArmy’s goal.
