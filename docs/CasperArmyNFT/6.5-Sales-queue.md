# 6.5 Sales purchase

## There are two types of queues in the operation of CasperArmy:
### 1. CasperArmyNFT purchase queue
- Your place in the queue to purchase CasperArmyNFT will be determined by your Soldier Rating, which will be assigned to your User Account on the Casper.army platform. The Soldier Rating is determined by the total amount of points you have accumulated in all areas where you can earn points. The more points you have and therefore the higher the Soldier Rating, the higher the priority of your place in the CasperArmyNFT purchase queue and the higher your chances of getting bought. Check out more under: Points System.
After buying CasperArmyNFT you will be assigned points corresponding to the rank of the NFT you bought, which will count towards your Soldier Rating.


### 2. A queue for listed projects on the Casper.Army platform. More information about the queue for listed projects can be found under:
